Note that \"small size\" has not deterred Fox, CNN and other US news channels/newspapers from covering, and even putting on the front page, Tea Party and other far right protests, some of which have had as little as 100 people (#occupywallst varies from 500-3000)",

The 2008 Presidential election holds the record for voter turnout with 63% of eligible voters voting. However good it is that 63% of voters voted, 37% did not express their opinions that day. Imagine if the record score for a math test was 63%. 37% is 78 million people, meaning 78 million people did not vote. Maybe they did not want to, or maybe they were delayed. To make every election day a national holiday (Election Day) would increase voter turnout not only by making that day a reminder to the people of their civic duty, but by giving them the time to vote. To increase voter turnout is to help show the true beliefs and opinions of the people of this great nation, and not just the beliefs and opinions of 63%.",

Kayaking is a low impact activity which poses minimal threat to the surrounding environment and enhances the personal experiential value of the Park. As custodians of the environment we would appreciate the opportunity to enjoy the beauty of the park by way of its lakes and rivers. In contrast to the other recreational sports which are allowed in the park, such as snowmobiling, kayaking would be one of the least invasive and most appreciated of the allowed recreational activities. The waterways in the park are some of the most unique and beautiful waterways of the plant. Thank you for you consideration of allowing us to experience them.",
