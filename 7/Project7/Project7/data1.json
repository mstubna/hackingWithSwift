These are thoughtful, rational and beneficial reforms.\n\nDo you, as president, trust the people and leaders in the individual states to enact their own marijuana laws or do you feel the federal government should impose prohibition on all 50 states?",

The 2008 Presidential election holds the record for voter turnout with 63% of eligible voters voting. However good it is that 63% of voters voted, 37% did not express their opinions that day. Imagine if the record score for a math test was 63%. 37% is 78 million people, meaning 78 million people did not vote. Maybe they did not want to, or maybe they were delayed. To make every election day a national holiday (Election Day) would increase voter turnout not only by making that day a reminder to the people of their civic duty, but by giving them the time to vote. To increase voter turnout is to help show the true beliefs and opinions of the people of this great nation, and not just the beliefs and opinions of 63%.",

TSA was supposed to publish the policy in the Federal Register, take comments from the public, and justify its policy based on public input. The court told TSA to do all this \"promptly.\" A year later, TSA has not even started that public process. Defying the court, the TSA has not satisfied public concerns about privacy, about costs and delays, security weaknesses, and the potential health effects of these machines. If the government is going to \"body-scan\" Americans at U.S. airports, President Obama should force the TSA to begin the public process the court ordered.",
